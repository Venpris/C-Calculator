# C-Calculator
A simple command line calculator written in C
that takes 3 arguments as input and returns
the result of the specified operation.

This is also my first personal project that I've put on
GitHub! Finished on 10/4/2023.

Apparently the "bug" I was experiencing was actually just me
entering the Linux EOF character (ctrl+D) instead of the
Windows EOF character (ctrl+Z). Well, you live and learn I
guess.
